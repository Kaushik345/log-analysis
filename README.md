# ADT-Project--Real-Time-Log-Analysis-using-Apache-Spark-and-Python-

Log analysis is mainly done to uncover the key patterns and problems faced by a user. But not many efficient solutions have been discovered to the patterns of user behavior through log analysis. 

By using log analysis, companies can analyze their system, application logs and apply predictive analytics on log data.​
This helps them find the problem in real-time and fix it before it creates damages.

The proposed  project will be equipped with the following features:

-Provide real time log analysis that automates the process of anomaly detection.

-Identifying the heterogeneous formats in the parsed data and performing pattern matching through clustering and tokenization

-Providing security alerts through anomaly detection by identifying the blocked websites, IP addresses and URLs.

-Creating a dashboard to display above features with better user interface.
